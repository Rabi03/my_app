for making a reposiotry in github 
u need a local repository and a remote repository 
the remote repository will be opened in the github
then the local repository will be in the directory where u want to keep ur project or files 
then after opening a remote repository in github


-> go to the directory where u want to make the local repository 
-> open the git bash 
-> write git init 
       after this you will see that in that directory there will appear a .git folder this means ur local repository is created
-> now connect the local repository with the remote repository
   write git remote add origin " the remote repository link which you will find in the clone section " (without qoute marks)
  
   ( now as ur local and remote repository are connected u can add files in your remote repository from your local repository )
-> to add your files of the local repository 
   write git add .
   
   ( now that ur files are added to the remote reposiotry its time to commit )
-> to commit 
   write git commit -m "anything u want" (ur update of files will be named according to the string u give here)
   
   ( now its time to name the branch where u want to push. this section is not needed if the name of the branch is already created )
-> to name a branch 
   write git branch -M main 
   
   ( now its finally time to push )
-> to push 
   write git push -u origin main


now for further commits and push you dont need to do some of the above steps 

as the local repository is already connected to the remote one u dont need to make the command git add remote origin

then as the name of the branch is also confirmed as main u also dont need to write git branch -M main during further commits and pushs

for further commits and pushs
just add files 
then commit 
then push 

write the 3 following lines 

-> git add .
-> git commit -m "anything u want"
-> git push -u origin main

thats it u are done 
that all the github u need to know for project 250 

as i have spend some of my valuable times of my life without sleeping just to make u understand github 
plz dont forget to give me a fuchka treat after the varsity opens

Thank You
